# Swagger generated server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements

Python 3.8

## Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 server.py
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/swagger.json
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t webinterface:latest "."

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8000:8000 webinterface:latest
```
